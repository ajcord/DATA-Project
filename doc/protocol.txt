Calculator-side:
*DATAlink packets are wrapped as TI bulk data packets (command byte 15h)
*Machine ID is 23h (PC sending TI-83+/84+ data)

Commands:
First byte is the command. Parameters come next for commands that require additional data.
00h: no-op. Polls the transmitter, which should respond with FFh. Must be the command immediately preceding any "dangerous" command, such as a shutdown/reset command.
01h: heartbeat. Polls the transmitter, which responds with FFh. Exactly the same as no-op, except it doesn't allow dangerous commands to execute.
10h and 11h: single channel packet. Next byte is LSB of channel number, third byte is channel value.
20h: set 256 channels at once. Next 256 bytes are channel values for channels 0-255.
21h: set 256 channels at once. Same format as above, but for channels 256-511.
22h: set 512 channels at once (bulk data transfer, as above).
23h: set multiple channels at once, starting from zero. Byte 1: length of data. Remaining bytes are channel data for channels 0 to Byte1.
24h: set all channels to the same value. Next byte is channel value.
25h: increase all channels by a value. Next byte is change value.
26h: decrease all channels by a value. Next byte is change value.
28h: start digital blackout (channel values stay in transmitter memory, but it broadcasts a blackout)
29h: end digital blackout (start transmitting stored DMX data again)
30h: copy channel data from 256-511 to 0-255
31h: copy channel data from 0-255 to 256-511
32h: exchange channel data between 0-255 and 256-511
33h: exchange channel data between 2 ranges. Byte 1: first channel (0-255). Byte 2: second channel (256-511). Byte 3: number of channels to copy
40h and 41h: request stored channel value for specific channel. Same format as 10h and 11h.
42h: request data from all 512 channels at once.
50h-DFh: reserved for future use
E0h: start transmitting DMX
E1h: stop transmitting DMX
E2h and E3h: set number of channels to broadcast (E2 for 0-255, E3 for 256-511). You can still set channels that aren't being broadcast (as scratch memory, for example - if broadcasting 256 channels, then channels 256-511 could be a second cue or a buffer. Remember that 32h can be used to swap scenes in this manner).
F0h: start shutdown sequence - only works immediately after no-op as a safety measure
     -once the transmitter replies with FFh and then EOT, it goes into sleep mode until one of the link lines goes low again
F1h: trigger soft reset - only works if the previous command was no-op
F8h: request current status of transmitter
F9h: request last error code (may not be current)
FAh: request firmware version number (1 byte, most significant nibble=major, least significant nibble=minor; e.g. 41h=v4.1)

Error codes:
00h: no error
01h: attempted to edit DMX values while DMX is disabled
02h: attempted to edit DMX output while digital blackout is enabled
03h: attempted to execute protected command when last command wasn't a no-op
10h: transmission timed out
11h: invalid data in bulk transfer
20h: invalid/out-of-range value
21h: unknown command received
FFh: unknown error

Status codes:
00h: OK
01h: digital blackout enabled
02h: DMX disabled
03h: protection is disabled
80h: heartbeat
81h: received no-op
FEh: getting ready to power down
FFh: ready for power down any moment

Notes:
-Protected commands must be received within 1 second after the preceding no-op command.
