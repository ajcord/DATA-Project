DMX-84 Arduino Source
=====================

Which file do I use???
----------------------

Use ./firmware/firmware.ino to put the full, up-to-date firmware on your
Arduino. The other directories exist for historical reasons and most likely
haven't been updated recently.

How do I use it???
------------------

Open the firmware file in your
[Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
If you haven't set up the IDE before, there are some good tutorials
elsewhere on the internet if you search for them. Once it's set up
with the right serial port and board, press Upload and watch the magic
happen.
