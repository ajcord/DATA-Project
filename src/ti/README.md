DMX-84 TI Source
================

Which file do I use???
----------------------

DMX.8Xp is the Axe include file that all the other source files require.
Files ending with 0 or theta are Axe source files. These cannot run by
themselves, so you have to compile them with the Axe app.

DMXDEMO is a demo program that shows you how to use some basic parts of
the API. "DMX Demo.zip" is a zipped folder that contains DMX.8Xp and
both the source and compiled versions of DMXDEMO.

EOHDEMO is a program written for Engineering Open House (at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) that implemenets a basic 32-channel
lighting control interface.

LITEBORD is a work-in-progress, full-featured, graphical lighting control
interface.

How do I use it???
------------------

To run precompiled programs:

Just send the compiled program to your calculator/emulator and run it.

To use source files:

Send DMX.8Xp to your calculator/emulator as well as any source files.
These programs can be edited in the TI Basic editor. To run them,
you must compile them using the Axe Parser app. These source files
were made for Axe 1.2.2.
